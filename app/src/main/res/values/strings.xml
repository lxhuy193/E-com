Whatever your reason, adding more green, luscious leaves to your home can be a great way to freshen up your place and create a calming environment.

Of course, not everyone has a green thumb when it comes to keeping plants thriving, but that’s alright because there are plenty of hard-to-kill houseplants out there that you can fill your rooms with. Don’t be fooled by their delicate appearance, they are more durable than you think; some can even withstand some serious neglect. So instead of trying to individually tend to each plant’s frequent watering schedules, we are sharing some of the best indoor plants that don’t require a ton of attention at all.

Before you set your heart on a plant you found on Amazon, you need to evaluate what kind is best suited for the amount of sunlight the room gets on a daily basis. Does it get direct sunlight, indirect sunlight or stays shady? Plants like yucca, ponytail palm and jade love a sunny room while other species like pothos, prayer plants and dracaena prefer shadier areas.

Once you’ve found the perfect indoor plant for its environment, you can have it delivered to your home — super easy! But of course, if you rather be on the safe side and not deal with any maintenance, then an artificial plant is your best bet! However, you’d be surprised how easy it is to take care of these hard-to-kill houseplants that we are sharing. Go ahead and give it a go!</string>
